This compose multiplatform app was built following the course by Philipp Lackner
on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT9-4DXUqsM).

In this course, I learnt:

1. MVI architecture
2. Building an offline first app using a remote api and a SQLite database.
3. Build an app that shares code between iOS, Android, and native desktop with platform specific
   implementations
